## Locked Out!

Some of you might have locked your keys in your car before, so this might be familiar territory for your. For everyone else, do not worry. There are many ways to get back inside your locked car (without having to bust one of the windows).

**Tools**:

Part of unlocking your car when the keys are locked inside is having the right tools. You might have seen some people trying to jimmy their lock open with a coat hanger while prying the door open with some large wrench or piece of metal. This might succeed in opening your car door, but it could lead to some very serious damages as well. In most cases it would be better off to use the right tools to get the job done.

- You want a long, thin, and sturdy rod that will be able to manually unlock the door from the inside.
- You also want something like an airbag that can safely pump your door open just enough to fit the rod inside. 
- There are also some special tools that unlock the pop locks. They are slim pieces of plastic that slide right into the slit in your door so you can just loop it around the lock and pop it up.

**Preventative Measures**:

There are certain measures you can take that will allow you to easily prevent this from ever happening again.

- Get a magnetic key box for a spare key and place it on your frame under your car.
- Newer security systems allow you to unlock your car with your phone as long as your keys are nearby.
- If you can't do either of these things, make sure you purchase some good tools that will allow you to unlock your car in the future.
